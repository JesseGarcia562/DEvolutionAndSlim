# DEvolutionAndSlim
Repo and vignettes for using SLiM 3.2.1 (https://messerlab.org/slim/), parallel computing (furrr: https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr), R (https://www.r-project.org/),  interpreted string literals (https://glue.tidyverse.org/), and differential evolution optimization (https://github.com/ArdiaD/DEoptim) for model selection and inference.


# Introduction
In this repo I discuss some of the new skills I learned this quarter of my PhD program. Everything is not to crazy on its own, but together they do something kind of cool. This tutorial has a very similar purpose as **13.8 Estimating model parameters with ABC** in the SLiM manual. However, here I incorporate parallel computing, the glue package from the tidyverse, and differential evolution optimization instead of ABC. 

# Prerequisites

## Install SLiM 3.2.1
This tutorial only works with SLiM
